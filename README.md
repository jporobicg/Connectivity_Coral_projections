# Connectivity_Coral_projections

This project focuses on connectivity and projections for coral populations using different proejection scenarios.
this model includes the effect of competence and decay of the larvae using the temperature at different source reefs.

## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing and projecting coral population connectivity using matrix-based calculations

## Features

- Matrix-based coral population modeling
- Connectivity analysis between coral populations
- Projection of future population states using competence and decay 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy (if used for advanced matrix operations)
- Matplotlib (if used for visualizations) [not used]

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python matrix_calculations.py`

## File Structure

- `matrix_calculations.py`: Main script for performing matrix calculations
- `data/`: Directory containing input data files (if applicable)
- `results/`: Directory for storing output files and visualizations

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the matrix calculations or extend the functionality are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss proposed changes.
