TODO []:
- [ ] Calculate the particles in overlaping reefs
- [X] Calculate connectivity for each reef and scenario
- [X] Change integration method to trapezoid. allow more flexibility in the integration method
- [X] test integration methods
- [ ] create a netcdf file with the connectivity data
- [ ] check theat the parcles are not removed from the analysis after settlement
- [X] get everything into the netcdf file
